An opiniated REST API boilerplate setup that uses the following technologies

- yarn (I think it's faster than npm - created by facebook)
- TypeScript (Strict af)
- Express
- Mongo
- Redis
- Jest (For unit tests - gamechanger)
- Prettier (For consistent code formatting)
- Husky (For making sure devs do not commit shit code - checks compilation errors and resolve formatting if needed. Can be extended to any pre-hook command imaginable)
- Docker Compose (Mostly for playing with db and redis on local)
- Logger
- Morgan (logs requests path and response time)
